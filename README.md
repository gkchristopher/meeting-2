# Mooresville Mobile Meeting 2

This code covers our 2nd meeting. We used the [Movie DB API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started) to show how to connect to a web service, pull down data, and transform it into model objects. All code was written using the native iOS and Android frameworks, with no 3rd party dependencies.
